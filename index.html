                ADHD is a developmental disorder associated with an ongoing pattern of inattention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsivity. 
                The symptoms of ADHD can interfere significantly with an individual’s daily activities and relationships. 
                ADHD begins in childhood and can continue into the teen years and adulthood.
